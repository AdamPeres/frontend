# Accessibility

We believe that our journalism should be accessible to everyone.

To achieve this, we aim to meet the [BBC HTML accessibility standards](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/html/).

## Testing

We have compiled the following testing guidelines for developers working on theguardian.com:

- [Screen readers](https://accessibility.gutools.co.uk/testing/web/screen-readers/)
- [Keyboard navigation](https://accessibility.gutools.co.uk/testing/web/keyboard-navigation/)
- [Colour contrast](https://accessibility.gutools.co.uk/testing/web/colour-contrast/)
